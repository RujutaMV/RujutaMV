### Hi there I am RujutaðŸ‘‹


I am an electronics engineer,originally from India, currently living in Frankfurt and learning Python online at DCI, Berlin. I'm currently learning more about how to use different Python libraries and frameworks. 

I may be a beginner in Python programming but I have worked for 3 years in other programming languages like C, C++ and MATLAB/Simulink. 
I have huge interest in data processing more specifically image processing as I have worked previously in this domain.

I like to learn coding by writing simple codes for various games.
Do checkout my repo: 

Apart from this, I love to read. Thrillers and murder mysteries (Agatha Christie) are my personal favorite. I also like to travel and hang-out with my friends!
I am open to collaboration work in image processing or creating a new game!
Feel free to connect with me on GitHub to collaborate on exciting projects or just say hello! ðŸ˜„
